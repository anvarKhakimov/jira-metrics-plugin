# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information that is processed by our Jira Metrics Plugin for Chrome. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we safeguard it.

## Information Collection

Our plugin performs the following actions:

1. **Requests to Jira**: The plugin makes requests to the Jira API to retrieve information about boards and tasks, analyze task movement across columns, and perform search queries to gather additional information necessary for reports.

2. **Local Storage**: The plugin uses your browser's Local Storage to save user settings, such as selected filters, dates, columns, swimlanes, and other configurations necessary for the convenient and proper functioning of the plugin.

3. **Google Analytics**: The plugin uses Google Analytics to collect anonymized data about user interactions with the interface. This data includes information about user actions such as navigation and button clicks. User identifiers are generated locally and do not contain personal information.

## Use of Information

- **Data from Jira**: Data retrieved from Jira is used solely for the purpose of analyzing and visualizing tasks, helping users better manage their projects. All data processing occurs locally in your browser. These data are not transmitted to Google Analytics or any other external service.
- **Anonymized Interaction Data**: Anonymized data collected via Google Analytics is used to analyze and improve the user experience with the plugin. Only interaction events, such as navigation and button clicks, are sent to Google Analytics, ensuring that no data from Jira is included.

## Information Sharing

We do not share or disclose data collected by the plugin with third parties. All data processing is conducted on the client side, except for anonymized interaction data sent to Google Analytics.

## Data Security

We take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the data processed by our plugin. The plugin operates within your browser and does not transmit data to external servers, except for anonymized interaction data sent to Google Analytics.

## User Rights

You have the right to know what data is processed by our plugin and how it is used. Since the plugin does not collect or transmit personal data, your data remains entirely under your control.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be posted on this page. We recommend that you periodically review this page to stay informed about any updates.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us through the contact information provided on our website or in the plugin.
